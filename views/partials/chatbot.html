	<p> Prototype of a chatbot program written in Prolog.</p>
	<p> The program reads user input and tries to construct a syntactic parse tree from the sentence's structure. The "semantic meaning" of the sentence is then extracted in the form of Prolog facts. If the sentence is a statement, the facts are stored in Prolog for future access. If it is a question, existing facts are queried and an answer is produced.</p>
	<p> The vocabulary is extremely limited, so here is a list of words that can be used safely: dog, cat, human, park, school, fur, peter, lisa, johny, cute, little, brown, loud, do, have, who, what, where, when, how. </p>
	<p> Example sentences: "johny met lisa", "lisa is a cute cat", "does johny have a dog ?", "peter s dog is in the park". </p>
	<p> (Note that "?" and "s" must be separate words.)
	<p> Source code for the chatbot can be found <a href="https://github.com/JonathanMurray/nlp"> here on github </a>.
